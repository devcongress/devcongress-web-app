Way to go, <%= @hacker.name.split.first %>!

The MPower Payments API, (http://mpowerpayments.com/developers/index.html) is the single most complete API for online payments and purchases in Ghana. On Saturday, October 5, 2013. We're (when I say _we_ I mean you are included!) spelunking the API!

We have special arrangements for everybody because not everybody coming will be a developer. So if you're a developer, make it easier for us to identify you by trying your hands on a couple of challenges we put together here: https://github.com/devcongress/hckthn/wiki/DevCongress'-MPower-Payments-API-Hackathon. Instructions related to the challenges are provided there. Don't panic, they're pretty easy challenges ;)

I'd keep you posted on further developments in the build up to the hackathon.

Let's do this!
