Thank you

We are indeed grateful for your efforts in making DevCongress 2013 a tremendous success.

Your contribution in the form of attendance, speaking, cash support, and sponsorship couldn't have come at a better time.

We look forward to receiving greater support from you as we forge ahead in our dream of developing Ghana's software developers.

It has been great working with you. You are our hero, and we celebrate you today. Thank you.
